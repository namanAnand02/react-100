        state.count++; // update state
        buttonComponentReRender(); // button Component re-render logic is written in this function which e simply call having made any change to state.
        // here, we are explicitly calling this component re-rrendering function, when we use React, we wont need to do this, react handles it for us.
        // re-render = taking the state and putting it on the screen
      }

      // the below function contains all the logic how re-rendering should happen after state change in button value
      // this is exactly what react automatically does for us - we are defining that ourselves here
      // Re-render function
      function buttonComponentReRender() {
        document.getElementById("buttonParent").innerHTML = ""; // clear old button
        const component = buttonComponent(state.count); // generate new button
        document.getElementById("buttonParent").appendChild(component); // append to DOM
      }

      // defined COMPONENT
      // functon through which we are generating button component
      function buttonComponent(count) {
        const button = document.createElement("button");
        button.innerHTML = `Counter ${count}`;
        button.setAttribute("onclick", `onButtonPress()`);
        buton.addEventListener("click", onButtonPress); // eventListener is better to be used.
        return button;
      }

      // the above function returns us a HTML tag
      // <button onclick= "onButtonPress">Counter 0 (0 wala part is dynamic here- count argument that is fed) </button>

      // so this generates a component : how a DOM element should render, given a state.
      // react component is very similar - it takes a dynamic variable as input and returns us the HTML tags mostly.

      // Initial render
      buttonComponentReRender();

<!-- 


The javascript is adding the button here on the webpage. 
Button is not defined in HTML. 
Javascript has the code base which brings the button on the page. 


In here, we had to define the render logic and also call it explicitly every time we update the state. 
But when we be using REACT, we wont need to do that. 
REACT will automatically detect the change in state and will ask the component to re render to show the change in the screen. 

In REACT, we just have to first define the state variable, then we need to define the component - -  we also will have to define the logic when does our state gets changed, like onButtonPress, change our state count by 1 
React under the hood will make sure that the state change gets updated on the screen.
